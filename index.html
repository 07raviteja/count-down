            <p>Time is an equal opportunity employer. Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day. Rich people can’t buy more hours.<br> Scientists can’t invent new minutes. And you can’t save time to spend it on another day. Even so, time is amazingly fair and forgiving.<br> 
                No matter how much time you’ve wasted in the past, you still have an entire tomorrow.</p>
